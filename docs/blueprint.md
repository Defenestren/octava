## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Wood Gold (#B2874D) to evoke a vintage yet elegant aesthetic, reminiscent of classic instruments. Complementing the carbon black, this adds richness and warmth.
- Background color: Carbon Black (#1F1F1F) for a sophisticated and premium feel that provides a strong contrast, enhancing readability and highlighting the brand's logo.

- Headline font: 'Rubik', a sans-serif font. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Roboto', a sans-serif font. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy, dividing content into distinct, easily navigable sections. Use white space strategically to improve readability and reduce visual clutter.
- Use icons inspired by musical instruments, vintage audio equipment, and sound waves. Aim for a simple line style with metallic gradients that evoke the brand’s identity.
